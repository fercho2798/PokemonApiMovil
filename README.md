# React-Native-Pokedex
A Pokedex mobile app developed with React Native
Developed as part of my learning React Native, this app was developed as part of a tutorial.
The tutorial showed how to create the app and display all the generation 1 pokemon (No.1-151).
I then took this further to display all pokemon from gen 1 to gen 6.

6/3/2021: updated to show pokemon from all 8 generations
